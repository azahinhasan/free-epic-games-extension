ICON GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS
============================

The extension will work without custom icons, but for best results, generate them using one of these methods:

METHOD 1: Using Browser (Easiest)
---------------------------------
1. Open generate-icons.html in any web browser
2. Click the download links to save icon16.png, icon48.png, and icon128.png
3. Save all three files in this icons/ folder
4. Reload the extension in Chrome

METHOD 2: Using Node.js
-----------------------
1. Install Node.js if you haven't already
2. Run: npm install canvas
3. Run: node create-icons.js
4. Icons will be generated in this folder
5. Reload the extension in Chrome

METHOD 3: Use Placeholder Icons
-------------------------------
If you don't want to generate icons, the extension will still work.
Chrome will show a default placeholder icon instead.

The extension functionality is not affected by missing icons.
